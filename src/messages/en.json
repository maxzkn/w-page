As she walked away, she turned and caught him mid-air, jumping of joy. He then cracked open a tiny whiskey bottle she'd given him for his birthday, and toasted the greatest moment of his teenage life. Just him, the sunset, and the start of something unforgettable. Oscar-worthy, honestly."

After a mildly traumatic misadventure, tulips were off the table. One day later, we went for a walk that led them to the Magere Brug. He nervously stalled by the bridge, then dropped to one knee. Emotionally stunned, she dropped too, embracing him. Neither of them remember what he said, just that she definitely said yes. A surreal, slightly chaotic, very 'them' kind of moment. It wasn't picture-perfect, but they've got forever to keep getting it wonderfully right. Every single day.",
